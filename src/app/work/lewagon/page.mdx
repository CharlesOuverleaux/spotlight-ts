When building a profile page, I wanted it to stand out, showcasing not just my skills but also my ideas and experiences. To make a great first impression, it had to be modern and fast—performance really matters here.

Highlighting my skills and experience meant designing a quick overview of my resume with an option for people to dive deeper if they’re interested. I also wanted a dedicated space to share articles about what I'm building or learning, a spot to really show my work in progress.

Lastly, I wanted an easy way to monitor the site’s performance and track visitor interactions, so I could see what’s working and where I might need to improve.

Putting this all together took some planning and creativity! Here's how I approached it.

## TailwindUI (React / Next.js / TypeScript / TailwindCSS)

<Image src={tailwindUI} alt="" />

In web development, there’s no shortage of CSS frameworks to choose from, each with its own perks. For my projects, I went with [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com/)—not just because I had access to the paid version, but because it’s genuinely so good for speed and flexibility. Tailwind lets you build fast, and when I want to customize something, it’s super adaptable.

Another bonus is that I’m working with Tailwind snippets in TypeScript, and along the way, I’ve picked up some really solid design patterns. It’s been a win for both productivity and leveling up my skills! For the first time, I used a template ([Spotlight](https://tailwindui.com/templates/spotlight)), and this was very close to what I needed.

Things I changed:

1. Removed the newsletter subscription
2. Added detailed job pages
3. Adapted the projects to link to job pages (can't believe Tailwind rick rolled me)
4. Removed the speaking part (I will add articles instead of having a specific page for that)

## Vercel

Once I got all my content in, I deployed my next.js app on vercel (the company behind next.js actually). It's such a good developer experience. You simply link up your github repository and you can deploy to production.

- Add maybe steps I had to follow.

## Monitoring

- Add performance monitoring & analytics

## Bonus SEO

- Add next.js for the win with meta data & ssr

```js
import { animate } from '@planetaria/animaginary'

export function MyComponent({ open, children }) {
  return (
    <animate.div
      in={open}
      animateFrom="opacity-0 scale-95"
      animateTo="opacity-100 scale-100"
      duration={350}
    >
      {children}
    </animate.div>
  )
}
```

Animaginary is our new web animation library that redefines what you thought was possible on the web. Hand-written in optimized WASM, Animaginary can even animate the `height` property of an element at 60fps.

## Improvements

It was really quick to develop and deploy everything. That being said, it is a personal preference to not have to go through git/github to edit the content of the site.
One quick way to solve this would be to add a CMS to this architecture. I've used Sanity and Contentful in the past and noticed that a few next.js projects come with Sanity. I believe this could really add value, especially if you hand over the content creation to someone else and don't want to give the access to the source code.
