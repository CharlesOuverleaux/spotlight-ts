Iâ€™ve loved building things for as long as I can remember, after working on the business side (Account Management and Marketing) for over 6 years, I decided to dive into software engineering to be able to create new products more independently.

I started my journey learning the fundamentals of programming on my own but quickly realized that I needed structure and hands on experience to be able to learn faster and more efficiently. In 2021, I joined a coding bootcamp (LeWagon) where I learned the basics of web development. Here are the two MVP project I built from ideation to production.
