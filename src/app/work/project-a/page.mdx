At Project A, I had the chance to contribute to a wide range of projects, from building products from scratch to enhancing large-scale platforms.

I often had to onboard quickly to different projects across various ventures, adapting to new teams, technologies, and domains in record time. This ability to hit the ground running ensured I could deliver high-quality work consistently, regardless of the project's complexity or timeline.

What made my experience at Project A particularly special was the opportunity to work within a venture capital-backed ecosystem. I partnered with great people in tech and business, gaining exposure to a diverse range of innovative startups and industries.
