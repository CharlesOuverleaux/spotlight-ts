When building a profile page, I wanted it to stand out, showcasing not just my skills but also my ideas and experiences. To make a great first impression, it had to be modern and fast.

Highlighting my skills and experience meant designing a quick overview of my resume with an option for people to dive deeper if they’re interested. I also wanted a dedicated space to share articles about what I'm building or learning, a spot to show work in progress.

Lastly, I wanted an easy way to monitor the site’s performance and track visits.

Here's how I approached it and what I have used:

## TailwindUI (React / Next.js / TypeScript / TailwindCSS)


There are so many CSS frameworks to choose from :) For my projects, I went with [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com/)—not just because I had access to the paid version, but because it’s genuinely so good for speed and flexibility. Tailwind lets you build fast, and when I want to customize something, it’s super adaptable.

Another bonus is that I’m working with Tailwind snippets in TypeScript, and along the way, I’ve picked up some really solid design patterns. It’s been a win for both productivity and leveling up my skills! For the first time, I used a template ([Spotlight](https://tailwindui.com/templates/spotlight)), and this was very close to what I needed.

Things I changed:

1. Removed the newsletter subscription
2. Added detailed job pages
3. Adapted the projects to link to job pages (can't believe Tailwind rick rolled me)
4. Removed the speaking part (I will add articles instead of having a specific page for that)

## Vercel

Once I got all my content in, I deployed my next.js app on vercel. I really enjoy how simple the process is. I simply linked up my github repository and deployed to production.

## Monitoring

Next.js has a super simple Web Analytics and Speed Insights available. I simply added the components to the root of the project. Adding this for my profile page is more than enough.

## Improvements

It was really quick to develop and deploy everything. That being said, I don't like to go through git/github to edit the content of the site.
One quick way to solve this would be to add a CMS to this architecture. I've used Sanity and Contentful in the past and noticed that a few next.js projects come with Sanity. I don't need it for this site but I for a blog it can be really helpful.
