*TypeScript type transformation for Sanity CMS: Automatically resolving references and removing system keys in dynamic page builder components*

## The Challenge

We decided to migrate our CMS from Contentful to Sanity, this to achieve substantial reductions in our monthly operational costs. While Contentful's pricing model had become misaligned with our content requirements, Sanity's structure allows us to maintain predictable, fixed operational expenses regardless of scale. Although the migration required a significant upfront investment in developer resources, this strategic move has positioned us for long-term cost efficiency and better aligns our infrastructure costs with our business needs.

When building dynamic page builders with Sanity CMS, developers face a fundamental type safety problem.  generates types based on raw data storage format, including unresolved references and internal system metadata. However, your frontend components need clean, resolved data structures.

This creates a critical mismatch between generated types and actual runtime data, forcing developers to choose between type safety and maintainability.
